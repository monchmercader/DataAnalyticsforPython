    "If natural languages are one of the many ways in which we communicate with one another, programming languages are what we use to communicate with our computers. When you click and interact with websites through a [graphical user interface (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), what makes that possible is the code running behind the scenes. This is essentially what python is, a language that allows us to communicate with our computers to create useful things together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can also be used in a variety of domains, from developing websites and mobile phone applications, to creating games and analysing data. Although the focus of this course will be on the latter category, data analysis, our hope is that by the end of the course, the transition from data analytics to any of the other domains in which python operates, would be a smooth one for you.\n",

    "### A bit of history\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created in the late 1980's, early 90's by [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/), a retired dutch programmer who's most recent role was at [dropbox](dropbox.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it so popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an excellent language with a lot of funtionalities, but one of its best characteristics is the plethora of [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) it has available to increase our productivity and improve our workflow when analysing data. You can think of these modules or libraries of code as the additional benefits of this language. Here is a metaphor to give you an example, we humans are very awesome just the way we are born (e.g., without clothes, language, knowledge, etc.), but in order to function better in society, and cruise through different stages of our lives, we make use of different languages and objects that provide us with a better experience. The clothes, the accessories, and the languages we use are our added benefits just like modules, packages and libraries are Python's added benefits (not the most clever analogy, I know, stay with me though😎).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ We will be using the terms library, module, and package interchangeably throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the modules that make up a big component of the data analytics/science ecosystem (and the ones we will use the most in this course), are the following ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -> \"is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) -> \"is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things, a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) -> \"is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Data Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) -> \"is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) -> \"s a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) -> Although Altair has not had the same adoption from the community as the previous two data visualisation libraries, it is a great library for visualising your data.\n",

IPython also has the very handy autocomplete funtionality which can save you from a lot of typing, especially when what you are trying to do needs to be fast and iterative.
