    "When working with data in Python you will encounter datasets coming in all shapes and formats, so it is crucial to understand how to deal with them in order to work with data. We will be covering the following 4 formats in this section (yes, there are only 4 here 😁):\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSV --> Comma Separated Values --> `pd.read_csv(file, sep=',')`\n",
    "- TSV --> Tab Separated Values --> `pd.read_csv(file, sep=' ')`\n",
    "- Excel --> Microsoft Excel format (.xlsx) --> `pd.read_excel()`\n",
    "- JSON --> JavaScript Object Notation --> `pd.read_json()`\n",
    "- HTML --> Hypertext Markup Language --> `pd.read_html()`\n",
    "\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Text files are extremely common among organisations, and hence, they will form a big part of the files you will encounter in your daily work. More specifically, files with a format such as **Comma** and **Tab** separated values, along with other text files that use different delimiters, might amount to half (if not more) of the files that you will see at work.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two formats, **Comma** and **Tab**, are still only a text file but they are very useful for saving and distributing small and large datasets in a tabular way. You can identify both kinds of files by looking at the suffix part in the name of a file, comma separated values will end in `.csv` while tab separated values will end with `.tsv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes these two files so similar is that they are both separated by something called delimiter. If you have a CSV or TSV file, try opening them in a plain text editor application (notepad for windows users and ) and notice what comes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "![csv](pictures/csv_file.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the example above, every value is separated by a comma and although the column headers can be found at the very top of the file (this is common practice) sometimes you might not even have them available. When we save files as TSV, CSV or with any other kind of delimiter, words with spaces in them will be wrapped around quotation marks to differentiate the spaces from the delimiter (which might be a space itself) in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, let's talk about how pandas handles these types of files. To read text files into a DataFrame with pandas we can use the function `pd.read_csv()` or `pd.read_table()`. These functions, at the time of writing, have over 50 parameters that allow us to customise different specification on how we would like to read in the data. One of the most important parameters is the `sep=`, which allows us to define the delimiter we would like to read in the data with. `\",\"` is the default for `pd.read_csv()` and `\"\\t\"` is the default for `pd.read_table()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters are some of the most useful ones not only for reading in text files, but also to tackle, and save time with, many of the operations you might need to perform after reading the data. Please visit the pandas documentation for more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `header=` --> tells pandas whether the first column contains the headers of the dataframe or not.\n",
    "- `names=[list, of, column, names]` --> allows us to explicitly name the columns of a dataframe in the order in which they are read.\n",
    "- `parse_dates=` --> gives pandas permision to look for what might look like date data and it will assign it the appropriate date data type format.\n",
    "- `index_col=` --> allows us to assign a specific column as the index of our dataframe.\n",
    "- `skiprows=\\[1, 2, 3, 4\\]` --> tells pandas which rows we want to skip.\n",
    "- `na_values=` --> takes in a list of values that might be missing and assigns them the NaN value, which stands for not a number.\n",
    "- `encoding=` --> data might coming in from a variety of sources could have different encodings, e.g. 'UTF-8' or 'ASCII', and this parameter helps us specify which one we need for our data.\n",
    "- `nrows=4` --> how many rows do you want to read from a file. Very useful tool for examining the first few lines of large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the Air Quality Monitoring Dataset and first read in the CSV file and then the TSV one."

These last two libraries are very powerful web scraping tools that you are more than encouraged to explore on your own. Intermediate to complex web scraping requires a fair amount of knowledge on how the structure of a website works but I have no dobts that with a few hours of focused studying, a couple of projects later, or in the next couple of minutes, you might be well on your way to scraping your own data with 🐼. 😎\n",

    "> **Web Scraping** refers to extracting data, structured or unstructured, from websites and making it useful for a variety of purposes, such as marketing analysis. Companies in the marketing arena use web scraping to colect comments about their products. Others, like Google, scrape the entire internet to rank websites given a criterion or search query. While web scraping might be limited in scope to a single website, like what a marketer might do, **web crawling** is the art of crawling over many different and/or nested websites on one try, or repeadately over time, like what Google does.\n",

An important thing to keep in mind is that, the pandas function `pd.read_html()` captures whichever tables it can find in the website provided and it then adds them to a list of dataframes where each  dataframe comes from a table. This means that you would have to first assign the list to a variable and then dump the table or tables you want into a combined dataframe.\n",
